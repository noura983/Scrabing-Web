The three-piece case construction, with DLC coated middle case barrel, follows Bremont’s signature design, however the sleek case measuring a mere 15.8mm is not typical of a sports chronograph which is normally housed in something much thicker. The Supermarine Chrono uses a chronometer rated La Joux Perret 7754 calibre chronograph movement with GMT functionality, appealing to global explorers and style seekers alike. The watch is available in both a black and blue dial variation and features a bi-directional ceramic and etched bezel, clearly displaying the markings for the 24hour functionality. The Supermarine Chrono has been designed to be worn with either an integrated bracelet or a rubber strap. The clear bronze hands are filled with SuperLuminova for increased readability, even with the sapphire crystal open case back, the watch is water resistant to 200 meters. The Bremont Supermarine dive collection was named as a tribute to the iconic British aircraft manufacturer responsible for the Supermarine S6B Schneider Trophy Seaplane and of course the incredible Supermarine Spitfire.Working with extreme adventurers and explorers has always been a key tenet of the Bremont brand DNA and a crucial part of the product testing.","A considerable amount of design detail has been carefully incorporated into the 43mm case of the new Supermarine Chrono.

Practical, robust and beautifully engineered, the 43mm Supermarine 500 diving watch follows an impressive line of marine predecessors which are not only iconic in design but highly durable and extensively tested out in the field. The Supermarine Descent II is named as a tribute to the original Limited Edition Bremont Supermarine Descent, the brand’s first limited edition dive watch. The Special Edition Supermarine Descent II is made from aviation grade titanium and bronze boasting a 42 hour power reserve with GMT functionality. The bronze hands and applied bronze indexes are set against a black dial and filled with Superluminova whilst the uni-directional rotating bronze bezel features a sapphire insert. A contrasting blue GMT hand further elevates this Supermarine model with dramatic effect. Turning the watch over reveals an open case back through which the beautifully finished and chronometer tested mechanical movement can be seen. As with all Supermarine models, high performance and endurance is key. The signature thicker crystal case back, originally tested for specific military units, is critical in ensuring that the watch can still reach depths of 500m. The new GMT diver, as with all Bremont watches, is built to chronometer specification. Over-engineered in all respects, the design of the Supermarine has been built using Bremont’s unique Trip-Tick® three-piece case construction with DLC treated barrel featuring an automatic helium escape valve and a distinctive off-set crown with crown protector on the side of the inner barrel. The Supermarine Descent II is available on a Harbour Blue or Black Rubber Strap.","Bremont brings back the ‘Descent’ with the release of the Supermarine Descent II, a striking new addition to the renowned Supermarine 500 collection.
