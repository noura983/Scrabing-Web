To date, the firm has saved over 7,600 lives.Martin-Baker first approached Bremont to create the definitive aviation watch back in 2007. More than simply putting a logo on an existing model, the watch had to withstand the same rigorous testing programme as the ejection seats themselves including Live Ejection Testing, MFOS Crashworthy Testing, Extreme Temperature Endurance, Vibration Testing, Altitude Testing and Aircraft Carrier Deck Testing. Two years later, the Bremont MBI was born. The limited edition MBI remains solely for pilots who have ejected from an aircraft using a Martin-Baker seat whereas the MBII and MBIII are available to all.The updated MBII design boasts a more contemporary styling of the numerals for a clean look. Its refreshed case back design is inset with a bronze coloured ‘military challenge coin’, historically used to represent membership of a group of people or service on a specific tour of duty.The Bremont MB has become something of an icon in the worlds of civilian and military aviation, it quite literally redefined the aviation watch space.",Designed to withstand the same rigorous testing programme that the Martin-Baker ejection seats go through including live ejection testing.
